You will need to install MySql and set the connection string in the `.env` file.

Once you do that, you proceed to open the project, select `Maplecodex2.DBSync` from the dropdown and start.

`yes` in the command in order to start parsing data and saving them into the database.
You finish parsing data into database.

Now you'll need the icons(find them in client in this location: `/Data/Resource/Image.m2d/(open with Orion2-Repacker)/item/icon/**`, export them), in order to get them you will have to extract them into --> `Maplecodex2/wwwroot/Data`
