# Maplecodex2 (Spring boot implementation)
## Here I re-coded the website project with spring boot. To use that, you have several options to set in `/src/main/resources/application.properties`: 
```
server.port=80                                                            // refer to which port to launch the site
storage.iconLocation=F:\\MapleStory2\\Maplecodex2\\Maplecodex2\\wwwroot   // refer to where icon folder is
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://192.168.0.120:3306/ms2codex            // refer to your mysql db IP and database name
spring.datasource.username=root                                           // refer to db user name
spring.datasource.password=123456                                         // refer to db user password
```
## But first you'll need to parse data with original Maplecodex2 version.
